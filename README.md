## Quick OS DL

This is a simple TUI tool to allow the user to quickly find URLs to (and download) images of various operating systems.

This project makes use of the JSON data from the [quickget_cigo](https://github.com/lj3954/quickget_cigo) project,
which allows this tool to work reliably, keeping up with new OS releases, without requiring constant updates.
